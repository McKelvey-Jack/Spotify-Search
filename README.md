### Welcome to my Spotify Search project

To get Started you will need to:

* Run coposer install
* Run npm install
* Create a .env file

To configure the spotify API you will need to add your spotify API client_id and client_secret to the .env file in this format:

```
CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX
```

When you have added this to your env run ```npm run dev ``` or ```npm run watch``` \
Finally, serve the project to your local host using ```php artisan:serve```
