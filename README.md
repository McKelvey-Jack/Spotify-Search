### Welcome to my Spotify Search project

To get Started you will need to:

* Run coposer install
* Run npm install
* Create a .env file

To configure the spotify API you will need to add your spotify API client_id and client_secret to the .env file in this format

```
CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX
```
